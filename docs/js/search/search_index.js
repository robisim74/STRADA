the dissertation of my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.\n\nDocumentation\nOfficial docs: STRADA documentation\nMotivation\nA widespread cliché wants urban traffic to be created because roads and public transport are insufficient or not working. Indeed, those who participated in the design of complex systems know perfectly that overdimensioning beyond average demand often does not give the expected results, or is not economically sustainable or for other factors. Traffic is due to population density and human activities that are concentrated in the same place or time. Even the Romans or medieval cities had busy roads: a sign of vitality, productivity, the ability of some centers to attract people and activities. In fact, over time, various meanings have been attributed to traffic: from \"trade\" to \"circulation\", but only in the automobile age the effect of congestion has replaced its original meanings to become the common use.\nAlthough traffic is inevitable in some situations, it is possible to study it in order to reduce the effect of congestion - as well as traffic accidents and pollution.\nSoftware simulators allow you to analyze, design, plan and manage urban mobility in order to find the best solutions for the traffic problems before adopting them in reality.\nThe STRADA simulator - Simulation of TRAffic DAta - is a web application that can process any transport network, obtain traffic data in real time and offer a simulation of traffic flow, with the purpose of controlling, estimating or predict traffic considering different conditions, such as different weather conditions.\nFeatures\n\nGraph generation of any transport network on a real map\nTransport demand calculation without extensive statistical surveys or expensive traffic sensors\nReal time factors such as weather conditions\nA macroscopic simulation model (LTM - Link Transmission Model) in the context of urban traffic\n\nArchitecture\n\nDevelopment\nRequirements\n\nNode.js and npm\nUpdate npm: npm install npm@latest -g\nAngular CLI: npm install -g @angular/cli\nFirebase\nCreate a Firebase project in the Firebase console\nFirebase CLI: npm install -g firebase-tools\nLogin: firebase login\n\n\nGoogle Maps \nGet your API keys: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/\nEnable Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API and Directions API\n\n\nOpenWeatherMap\nGet your API key: https://openweathermap.org/\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nUpdate .firebaserc file\nUpdate src/app/app-config.json file\nUpdate functions/src/functions-config.json file\n\nFirebase Functions\ncd functions\nnpm install\nnpm run serve:devApp\nnpm install\nnpm startTest\nnpm testLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Roberto Simonetti\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
